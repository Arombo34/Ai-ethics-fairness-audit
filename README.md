Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.

Answer:
Algorithmic bias occurs when an AI system produces systematically unfair outcomes for certain groups due to biased training data, flawed assumptions, or design choices. It can lead to discrimination against individuals based on race, gender, age, or other protected attributes.

Examples:

Facial recognition systems misidentifying darker-skinned individuals more frequently than lighter-skinned individuals.

Hiring algorithms favoring male candidates over female candidates because historical hiring data used for training reflects past gender imbalances.

Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?

Answer:

Transparency refers to openness about how an AI system works, including its design, training data, and algorithms. It allows stakeholders to understand the decision-making process at a high level.

Explainability is the ability to provide interpretable justifications for specific AI decisions, helping users understand why a particular outcome occurred.

Importance:

Both are essential for building trust in AI systems, ensuring accountability, and enabling users and regulators to detect errors, biases, or unfair outcomes.

Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?

Answer:
GDPR imposes strict rules on data collection, processing, and storage, requiring user consent and protection of personal data. For AI:

AI systems must minimize use of personal data and ensure privacy.

Developers must provide explainable outcomes when decisions affect individuals (e.g., automated hiring, credit scoring).

Non-compliance can lead to fines and legal action, incentivizing ethical and transparent AI development.
